      <h4>1. What is PERF?</h4>
      <p>
        PERF is a mobile wellness solution that transforms any room or private space into a personal gym — offering your guests fitness, recovery, and relaxation without needing a traditional fitness facility.
      </p>

      <h4 class="py-20">2. Do I need a gym in my establishment to use PERF?</h4>
      <p>Not at all. PERF is designed for properties with & without gyms. It brings the full wellness experience directly into the guest room or suite.</p>

      <h4>3. How does PERF generate revenue for my business?</h4>
      <p>You can offer PERF as a premium in-room amenity or charge per session. It increases perceived value and creates a new income stream — with no need for construction or extra space.</p>

      <h4>4. What's included in a PERF kit?</h4>
      <p>
        Each unit includes compact, high-quality fitness tools and access to a library of guided workouts, recovery sessions, and mindfulness routines.
      </p>

      <h4>5. How do I get started?</h4>
      <p>Just contact us or request a demo. Once your account is activated, we provide full setup support and help integrate PERF into your rooms or guest spaces.</p>

      <h4>6. Is there training or support for staff?</h4>
      <p>
        Yes. We offer onboarding and optional training so your team can present and manage PERF easily and professionally.
